# Data Visualization in Python: Matplotlib

If you want to create reproducible, concise, and effective charts in Python, there is almost no way around one library: Matplotlib.

Matplotlib is a Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Its core design philosophy is that you should be able to create simple plots with just one line of code, and complex visualizations with just a few more. Matplotlib is especially popular in the context of scientific visualizations for publications in research papers and supports ways to save your visualizations in various formats, such as PNGs, SVGs, or even PDFs. It is so well-made, versatile, and popular that other data visualization libraries also use it under-the-hood! So even if you prefer to use seaborn for your data visualizations (see workshop on 2/26) or like to plot directly from pandas, knowing your way around matplotlib will accelerate your data visualization workflow!


Join us for this session to learn about the anatomy of a matplotlib chart, how to find and implement the right chart for your data, and how to group multiple charts together in a single visualization.

To get the most out of this session, you should have some basic experience with Python. The contents are designed to be very beginner-friendly, however.
